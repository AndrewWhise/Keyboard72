# Keyboard72
by Andrew Whise, Whisenand Music, 2023.

Version 0.3.3

Keyboard72 is a tool for musicians composing in the 72-tone equal temperament.
Each half-step is divided into 6 discrete pitches, turning the standard
12-note octave into 72 notes. This allows for exotic harmonies (both consonant
and dissonant), as well as a much more accurate realization of the harmonic series.

Made with Godot Engine v3.2.3
